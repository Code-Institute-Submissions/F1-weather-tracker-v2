Milestone Project 4: Full Stack Frameworks with Django â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my fourth and final milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for Formula 1 fans like myself, to provide them with accurate weather data of event locations. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website with a relational database using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. Additional requirements were to set up authentication, and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities using Stripe payments.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

The goal for the website is to provide Formula 1 fans with accurate weather data of event locations.

#### User stories

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to see the Formula 1 calendar**, so that **I know which events are happening soon**.

- As a **premium member**, I would like **to access hourly weather data**, so that **I can better estimate under what weather conditions the race will be held**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like **to have an authentication system**, so that **I can give customers premium membership status**.

### Scope

#### Functional specifications

The website should have navigation to switch between all the pages. Content on the website should support different screen sizes. Wherever appropriate and or possible, visible indicators should be shown to users when they can perform an action on the website (like clicking a link or a button).

#### Content requirements

The website should display the Formula 1 calendar, daily weather forecast data, and hourly weather forecast data. There should be pages for registering and logging in. There should be a page where customers can purchase premium membership.

### Structure

#### Information architecture

Every page has a hamburger menu icon with navigation links. The homepage advertises the purpose of the website and provides additional navigation to the register page. The Formula 1 calendar page has navigation to each (active) event. The individual event pages have navigation to the hourly and daily weather data pages.

#### Interaction design

Depending on their device, users could see through visible indicators like changes of colour and/or changing mouse pointers whether something is clickable. Icons such as an arrow pointing down indicate to users that an element can be expanded. Users with touchscreens can swipe up and down to scroll through the page, and they can (double)tap to select buttons and navigation elements. No audio will be used in this website.

### Skeleton

For all screen sizes the skeleton should be quite the same. The header will have a hamburger menu icon on the left, and a logo or some text in the center. The footer will probably reference the weather API. The homepage displays an image with some advertisement and navigation to the register page. The Formula 1 calendar page has a card for each event. Each individual event page has two cards, one for the daily weather forecast and one for the hourly weather forecast. The daily weather forecast page has a country flag and track name at the top, underneath that the local time of the event location is displayed, underneath that the event schedule is displayed, underneath that there are seven cards that display weather data for the next seven days. The hourly weather forecast page is the same as the daily weather forecast page, except that there are twenty-four cards with weather data instead of seven, one for each hour of the current day.
