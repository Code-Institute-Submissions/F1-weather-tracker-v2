Milestone Project 4: Full Stack Frameworks with Django â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my fourth and final milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for Formula 1 fans like myself, to provide them with accurate weather data of event locations. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website with a relational database using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. Additional requirements were to set up authentication, and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities using Stripe payments.

**Attention!** I highly suggest reading the [**notes section**](#notes) before taking a deeper dive into my project.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

The goal for the website is to provide Formula 1 fans with accurate weather data of event locations.

#### User stories

- As a **visitor**, I would like **to see the Formula 1 calendar**, so that **I know which events are happening soon**.

- As a **premium member**, I would like **to access hourly weather data**, so that **I can better estimate under what weather conditions the race will be held**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like **to have an authentication system**, so that **I can give customers premium membership status**.

### Scope

#### Functional specifications

The website should have navigation to switch between all the pages. Content on the website should support different screen sizes. Wherever appropriate and or possible, visible indicators should be shown to users when they can perform an action on the website (like clicking a link or a button).

#### Content requirements

The website should display the Formula 1 calendar, daily weather forecast data, and hourly weather forecast data. There should be pages for registering and logging in. There should be a page where customers can purchase premium membership.

### Structure

#### Information architecture

Every page has a hamburger menu icon with navigation links. The homepage advertises the purpose of the website and provides additional navigation to the register page. The Formula 1 calendar page has navigation to each (active) event. The individual event pages have navigation to the hourly and daily weather data pages.

#### Interaction design

Depending on their device, users could see through visible indicators like changes of colour and/or changing mouse pointers whether something is clickable. Icons such as an arrow pointing down indicate to users that an element can be expanded. Users with touchscreens can swipe up and down to scroll through the page, and they can (double)tap to select buttons and navigation elements. No audio will be used in this website.

### Skeleton

For all screen sizes the skeleton should be quite the same. The header will have a hamburger menu icon on the left, and a logo or some text in the center. The footer will probably reference the weather API. The homepage displays an image with some advertisement and navigation to the register page. The Formula 1 calendar page has a card for each event. Each individual event page has two cards, one for the daily weather forecast and one for the hourly weather forecast. The daily weather forecast page has a country flag and track name at the top, underneath that the local time of the event location is displayed, underneath that the event schedule is displayed, underneath that there are seven cards that display weather data for the next seven days. The hourly weather forecast page is the same as the daily weather forecast page, except that there are twenty-four cards with weather data instead of seven, one for each hour of the current day.

#### Wireframes

To see all the wireframes in a single PDF [click here](docs/wireframes/f1weather_wireframes.pdf).

To see separate PNG image files of the wireframes check the docs/wireframes folder.

### Surface

#### Colours

The main colours will be dark gray and yellow again, just as with my milestone two project. I will use the blue colour for weather data such as precipitation and rain. The red colour will most likely be used for temperature data. Instead of making the entire website dark gray again by using it for the background, I will use a regular white colour for a cleaner look and better visible separation between elements. The green colour will be used for minimum temperature in the daily weather forecast data.

![Colour palette](docs/colour-palette/colour-palette.png)

#### Typography

In total, I've used three different font families from the Google Fonts library. The font Ubuntu was used for regular things like the header and footer, and additionally for most buttons as well. The font Titillium+Web is similar to the one used on the official Formula 1 website and was used for most of the main content on the website. The font Inter was used for displaying the weather data.

#### Uniformity

To keep the website looking uniform I will do my best to make sure that all related content throughout the website is consistent in font-size and styling. The positioning of elements and content should be consistent in height, padding, and spacing. I'm also using either grid, flexbox or both to present the content in a logical order, either through custom CSS or through external styling frameworks.

## Features

### Existing features

#### General features

**Header**:

- Will always be visible at the top of every page.
- Has clickable text/logo in the center that returns the user to the homepage.
- On the left side it has a hamburger menu icon clicking it opens the side navigation menu.

**Side navigation menu**:

- Will be visible at the left of every page after clicking the hamburger menu icon.

- Has a div telling the visitor to register and mentions buying premium membership to access additional weather data. This div also has a button with an internal link to the register page.

**Calendar page**:

- Has cards for each of the (remaining) Formula 1 calendar events. Each card shows the event date and location. Clicking on active cards takes you to the single event page.

**Single event page**:

- Has a wide div that displays the country flag for the selected event and the track name.
- Has two cards. One card has an internal link to the hourly forecast page, and the other card has an internal link to the daily forecast page.

**Hourly forecast page**:

- The data on this page is only accessible for users with a premium membership.
- Has a wide div that displays the country flag for the selected event and the track name.
- Has a wide div that displays the local time of the event location.
- Has a div with the event schedule which included all the local starting times for each session.
- Has twenty-four cards with weather data for the selected event, one card for each hour of the day.

**Daily forecast page**:

- Has a wide div that displays the country flag for the selected event and the track name.
- Has a wide div that displays the local time of the event location.
- Has a div with the event schedule which included all the local starting times for each session.
- Has five cards with weather data for the selected event, one card for each of the next five days.

**Premium page**:

- This page is only accessible for users who don't have a premium membership yet.
- Shows the logged in user their email address.
- Has an element for executing a Stripe payment to purchase premium membership.

**Profile page**:

- This page is only accessible for logged in users.
- Shows the logged in user their email address.
- Shows the logged in user their premium membership status.

### Future features

- Adding more functionality to the user profile page, such as email and password change.

- Add a function to display the actual local time of a selected event.

- Add actual API weather data to the database each hour for each calendar event. This whole project has been an absolute nightmare, I didn't even have time to try to implement this. But in hindsight it would've been a waste of time anyway, since I'll take this project offline as soon as I get my grade. If I ever decide to actually build this it will be with NodeJS.

## Deployment

### Set up database

To deploy this project yourself you'll need to set up a local database, there are multiple options for this such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/). Make sure to pick the right version for your operating system. With PostgreSQL, if you'd like to deploy on Heroku, make sure you install PostgreSQL version 12 or 13 because apparently they don't support older versions. After you installed the database service of your choice you'll have to re-create my database according to my [**database schema**](#database-schema).

### Hosting online

This project was hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) with the following steps:

1. First of all you need to clone my repo and add it to your own Github account.
2. Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login).
3. Select **new** and **create new app**.
4. Choose a unique app name and select a region.
5. Click **connect to github**.
6. Enter your repo name and click search.
7. Click **connect**.
8. Now to attach a postgres database to the project click on the **resources** tab.
9. Under Add-ons search for Heroku Postgres and select the **Hobby Dev - Free** option.
10. Now scroll up and click on the **settings** tab.
11. Click **reveal config vars**.
12. Add the correct environment variables (you can find some of these by clicking the settings tab in your Heroku Postgres add-on and then click on view database credentials): 

```
DATABASE_CNAME = <your database name>
DATABASE_HOST = <your host>
DATABASE_PASSWORD = <your database password>
DATABASE_PORT = <your database port>
DATABASE_URL =  <your database URL>
DATABASE_USER =  <your database user>
SECRET_KEY = <your secret key>
STRIPE_API_KEY = <your stripe API key>

```

13. Make sure to comment out the DEBUG variable in your local .env file if you have that, then run the command `py manage.py makemigrations`
14. Then run the command `py manage.py migrate`
15. Create a superuser, so you can access the django admin, run the command `py manage.py createsuperuser`
16. Those are all the steps, I think. Honestly, I had to follow multiple YouTube tutorials to get things working. The initial deployment was a giant mess because I built my database with PostgreSQL 9.6 and apparently Heroku doesn't support that version. There is a possibility that I forgot to mention a step or two. Even if I correctly mentioned all the steps, people are using different operating systems and software versions, it's better for people to search for a recent tutorial for their specific situation. As long as they use the correct config vars they should be fine.

### Running locally

Again, how to run this project locally depends on your operating system and software versions. I used a desktop version of Visual Studio Code and PostgreSQL 13 with pgAdmin4. These are roughly the steps I took:

1. First of all, re-create my database according to my [**database schema**](#database-schema) with a database service of your choice (I suggest PostgreSQL 13).
2. Download and install the appropriate versions of Python, Visual Studio Code, and GIT for your computer.
3. Download the repo from my Github and extract it in a folder on your computer.
4. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
5. Set up a virtual environment with the command `python -m venv env`
6. Activate this virtual environment with the command `source "<path_to_your_project_folder>/env/Scripts/activate"`
7. In your terminal, make sure you are in the root directory and enter the following command: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
8. Create a .env file in the f1_weather_tracker folder and put your local environment variables in there:

```
# environment variables
DEBUG = True
SECRET_KEY = <your secret key>
STRIPE_API_KEY = <your stripe API key>

# Local DB
DATABASE_CNAME = <your local database name>
DATABASE_USER = <your local database user>
DATABASE_PASSWORD = <your local database password>
DATABASE_HOST= '127.0.0.1'
DATABASE_PORT = '5432'

```

9. Run the command `py manage.py makemigrations`
10. Run the command `py manage.py migrate`
11. Create a superuser, so you can access the django admin, run the command `py manage.py createsuperuser`
12. Run the command `py manage.py runserver`
13. You should be able to visit the website by entering http://127.0.0.1:5432/admin/ in your browser.
14. Again, to the best of my knowledge I think these are all the steps, but I also might have forgotten one or two. And these steps are very specific to certain operating systems and software versions anyway.

## Notes

- This project has been an absolute nightmare from the start all the way through to the end. Even prior to this project, being forced to learn Django even though I already know I'll never ever use it again is frustrating. Since finishing my 3rd milestone project I know for certain that I don't want to work with Python in my career, I really hate it. After my 3rd milestone project it was very clear to me that I would like to specialize in JavaScript, and also learn C#. So prior to this project, in the past couple of months, I've been learning NodeJS and Vue. Apparently you don't get your diploma unless you pass all 4 milestone projects, despite having enough points already. So I had no choice but to learn Django, well... it certainly would have been helpful if the learning material was any good. It's honestly unbelievable that I paid thousands of â‚¬ for this course and they only show you how to build a single project, in a $10 Udemy course they show you multiple different projects and give way more in-depth explanations. The whole Django project they showed in the Code Institute course material was full of lazy copy pasted stuff, and to make matters worse they require you to have a credit card (which I don't have) and sign up to Amazon AWS to deploy it. When I had to start building this project I didn't feel ready whatsoever. Things got even worse, I started my 4th milestone project with a concept that I thought about for many months already, even before my 3rd milestone project. But soon after I got started I found out that the API that I wanted to build on wasn't there, so I had to switch project ideas unexpectedly after having started already. I then struggled hard to set up a database because the Code Institute course didn't show how to use PostgreSQL so I ended up following a tutorial that used PostgreSQL 9.6 which got me into a lot of trouble. Apparently Heroku doesn't support PostgreSQL 9.6 but how was I supposed to know this? I spend days trying to get my database to work, but it wouldn't. Ended up having to rebuild the entire database from scratch in PostgreSQL 13. All of this cost me a lot of time and I was already struggling enough just to understand the normal Django functionality, running into problem after problem. I also only had one single mentor talk, which was during my PostgreSQL struggles, so I never had anyone take a look at my code. During my mentor talk I learned another thing that would have been crucial to know beforehand, my plan was to request weather API data once per hour for each location, but my mentor told me that Heroku servers go to sleep after 20 minutes. Being in such a mess already I decided to leave the weather API until the end, I'd rather finish the core of the website first, and if I had time left I could find a solution for the API to work on Heroku as intended. I'm glad I saved the API integration for last, because I ended up not even getting there, if I had tried that I wouldn't have made the project deadline. All the API work would have been a waste of time anyway, since if I might build this into a real project one day it will be built with NodeJS. At least now this project has given me some structure and front-end that I can re-use, so it wasn't all a giant waste of my time. Of course as a cherry on top I also hurt my arm 3 days before the deadline, making it very hard to type, I'm on painkillers right now as I'm typing this. In the end there were also problems with the email server that Code Institute showed how to set up, I got some SMTPAuthenticationError and my entire allauth was broken on the deployed website, it was impossible to log in or register. I'm glad I caught this issue before submitting the project, and I was even more surprised when I heard that an email server was not even necessary. Why the hell do they show us this in the first place then? This email server was just another giant waste of my time and a cause of unnecessaryÂ problems. In the end I managed to finish the project aside from the weather API integration, which is kind of a miracle, seeing how I went from one disaster to the next disaster. Nobody has looked at my code, my mentor wasn't available during the final week because he is getting married I think, so I have absolutely zero clue if I've done things the right way. Now that the project is finished (weather API aside) I think the core structure is pretty good, it looks and works as intended except for not having live API weather data. There is just no way I'm putting this project in my portfolio, I'm taking it offline as soon as I receive my grade. I'm so fed up with anything Python and I'm not spending another minute on it in my life.
