Milestone Project 4: Full Stack Frameworks with Django â€“ [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

This website was made as my fourth and final milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for Formula 1 fans like myself, to provide them with accurate weather data of event locations. The project requirements were to create a full-stack website with a relational database using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. Additional requirements were to set up authentication, and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities using Stripe payments.
